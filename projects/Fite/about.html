                <span style="font-size:19px; font-weight:bold; color:#666666">The Beginning</span><br>It was back in 1958 when a little girl approached Mrs. Matilde Osuna seeking help.  This young girl and her little sister lived under constant sexual abuse by their stepfather.  Mrs. Ruiz was moved by their story and decided to protect them. Soon, word spread out and due to the similar conditions under which other girls where living, they too asked for help. It was then that Mrs. Celia Osuna, Doña Mati’s sister, opened a small house she owned to shelter and protect these girls. Miss Ines Contreras volunteered to look after them. That is how what today is known as Casa Hogar Mamá Paulita started. <br><br><span style="font-size:19px; font-weight:bold; color:#666666">Home Built</span><br>In 1968 it was legally constituted as a Civil Association and was granted the right to give tax deductible receipts. A board was formed by descendants of the funding members, who have worked ever since to continue this ministry. In 1969, with donations from family members, friends and Mr. Irigue D.Jansen, on a piece of land donated by Mrs. Celia Osuna and Mrs. Ofelia Saenz, construction was started (adequate dorms, bathrooms, a kitchen, dining room and laundry room). This construction was finished in 1971. As more children came to the house, two separate dorms for boys with its bathrooms, play room and a house for the directors, were built.

                <span style="font-size:19px; font-weight:bold; color:#666666">Need for Donations</span><br>In 1982, with the help received from Caring Action for Children, a school was built next to the main house. This school, Professor and General Gregorio Osuna, is a pre-school / elementary during the mornings. It also serves as a refuge in times of floods as it is equipped with bathrooms and a full kitchen. This work continues because of people and institutions who identify with the vision of transforming these children’s lives, and make generous contributions and donations. However, natural damage to the property brought by time, which takes us to constant renovations, as well as the high living costs in today’s economy, make the maintenance of this project a challenge which is harder to meet each day. <br><br><span style="font-size:19px; font-weight:bold; color:#666666">Our Goal</span><br>Our mission is to keep working with the purpose of giving these kids, that God has placed on our hands, all the tools necessary so they may have an opportunity to strive for a better future and have a positive impact on their community.
