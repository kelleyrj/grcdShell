									<p>One of the greatest contributors to meltdowns and behavioral outbursts in the classroom for children with Autism is their inability to verbally communicate their wants and needs. What if classroom communication between students with Autism and their teachers could be improved, meltdowns could be prevented, and verbal communication could be encouraged with an interactive tool? Our iPad application promotes success in education by allowing children with Autism to verbally communicate their wants and needs through imagery and sound.</p>

						 <p> We believe that creativity is cultivated through a healthy balance between digital and physical play. To test this theory, we are creating an iPad application that fuses origami paper craft and elements of a drawing application to promote creative play in both a digital and physical environment.</p>

He has been an avid fantasist his entire life and now can't seem to turn off his filter for design thinking. His CS buddy Matt Fye is pretty cool too. They have co-created unscriptedGames LLC and plan to pursue their passion for game design in their spare time after college.</p>
